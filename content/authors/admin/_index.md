I am a senior consultant and AI research scientist in the area of AI (Artificial Intelligence), with special expertise on reliable, efficient, and secure AI systems. 

Reliability means that the AI is really doing what it should do. Efficiency means that the AI works with minimal resources (runtime, energy, memory). Security means that it is robust against manipulations and adversarial threats. 

Prior to joining _fbeta, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher in the area of trustworthy AI at Ruhr University Bochum and at ICSI, an affiliated institute of the University of California (UC Berkeley). I got my PhD in Computer Science from TU Braunschweig, focusing on trustworthy AI as well as on the intersection of machine learning and computer security. 


**Key Knowledge and Skills**:
- Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence
- AI processing of natural language, of digital media such as images, videos, or audio, and of program code
- AI model training from scratch, AI model finetuning 
- Detection of AI-generated content and deepfakes
- Trustworthy AI (Reliability, Security, Bias, Misuse)
- Efficiency of AI
- AI for computer security, fraud detection, and privacy
